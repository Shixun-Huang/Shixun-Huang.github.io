I received my bachelor's degree of Software Engineering in 2015 from Nanjing University and received my master's degree of Information Technology in 2017 from the University of Melbourne. Currently, I am a Computer Science PhD candidate at RMIT University working with [Zhifeng Bao][zhifeng] and
[J. Shane Culpepper][pepper]. My research is
centered within the intersection of Graph Data, Machine Learning and
Efficient Algorithms.
